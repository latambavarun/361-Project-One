  <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
  <p>
    What makes me, me!
  </p>
  <h4>Music</h4>
  <p>
    Since the day I was born, music has been in my ears. My father is a
    singer, and my first memories are of him singing.
    (Elaborate)
    I became a musician at age 7. I started with piano. I then moved onto
    saxophone at 10. Finally finding my true love with guitar at age 12.
    I have kept that instrument since.
    (Elaborate)
    (Why music is so important for my sanity and confidence)
  </p>
  <h4>Skateboarding</h4>
  <p>
    Everyone and their mothers have skated at one point or another.
    I started in middle school but then stopped. I picked it back up
    close to high school graduation, and hung onto to it since.
    I have been skating for about 5 years now and it is amazing form
    my fitness and mental. Learning tricks takes commitement,
    which is a true mental battle.
    (Elaborate on how that mentality can be used for pretty much everything else in life)
