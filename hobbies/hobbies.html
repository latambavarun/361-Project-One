    Since the day I was born, music has been in my ears. My father is a
    singer, and my first memories are of him singing. Music runs through
    my family. My brother is a percussionist and we grew up jamming together,
    the first jam session at the age of 4 as I held a stick as a microphone
    and my brother banged on cookie tins, cans, etc. The experience continued
    from performing with my brother and father on stage at age 7, to winning rock bang
    competitions with my brother at age 15. To this day, we jam.
    I became a musician at age 7. I started with piano. I then moved onto
    saxophone at 10. Finally finding my true love with guitar at age 12.
    I have kept that instrument since. Learning guitar has shaped my personality
    and confidence. My strive for creativity has shaped my thinking process.

  <h4>Skateboarding</h4>

    Everyone and their mothers have skated at one point or another.
    I started in middle school but then stopped. I picked it back up
    close to high school graduation, and hung onto to it since.
    I have been skating for about 5 years now and it is amazing form
    my fitness and mental. Learning tricks takes commitement,
    which is a true mental battle. I challenge myself in skating to this day.
    I feel like pushing my mental out of its comfort zone helps me in life.
    I am a strong candidate in any field that I put myself in. This is because
    I am comfortable with puttin myself out of my comfort zone to achieve
    greatness.
